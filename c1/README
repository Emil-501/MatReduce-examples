Case1: ACL + LB

Original Match Times : 8
Optimized Match Times: 7

The program in this case has two NFs, ACL and LB. See p4src/optimize.p4 and rules/optimize.txt for more details of our mechanism.

To run this demo, you should open two terminals, T1 and T2:

1.start mininet in T1:
* ./run.sh p4src/[origin.p4|optimize.p4]

2.populate control rules in T2:
* ./set_switch.sh rules/[origin.txt|optimize.txt]

3.Observe TCP traffics inside mininet:

mininet> xterm h1 h2

h2> arp -s 10.0.0.1 00:00:00:00:00:01
h2> iperf -s -i 1

h1> arp -s 10.0.0.2 00:00:00:00:00:02
h1> iperf -c 10.0.0.2 -t 60 -i 1
